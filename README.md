# HackerRank Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

A personal playground where I sharpen my data‑structures and algorithms skills by solving HackerRank challenges. Every solution is fully‑documented, version‑controlled, and benchmarked so I can measure both accuracy and speed as I progress.

Why this repo? Because coding interviews don’t forgive half‑baked fundamentals—and repetition is the mother of memory.
